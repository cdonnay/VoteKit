        "VoteKit is a Python package developed by MGGG in order to support computational social choice researchers as well as practitioners and advocates interested in so-called \"alternative\" systems of election. This first section will help us hit the ground running by introducing some of our key vocabulary and introducing some Python syntax along the way. By the end of the section, you should know about ballots, preference profiles, preference intervals, blocs/slates, and election systems.\n",

        "The first order of business is ballots. In the context of ranked choice voting, a ballot records a voter's preferences as a linear ordering of the candidates. If a voter casts the ballot $A>B>C$, this means they prefer candidate $A$ to $B$ and candidate $B$ to $C$. (We often use the $>$ symbol to indicate higher preference.) Let's see how ballots are stored in VoteKit. First we import the necessary modules."
