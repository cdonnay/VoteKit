    "MGGG also maintains a package called `gerrychain`, which is used to draw legislative districts. One common pipeline that we use in the lab is to generate a large number of possible maps using `gerrychain`, and then for each district in each map, use VoteKit to understand possible election outcomes. This section of the tutorial provides a short example of how this might be done."
